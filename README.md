All posts can be found in the `posts` folder in the master branch. Use existing posts as a format reference. 
Click `_posts` to enter the folder. You can click an existing post file to view it. Click the pencil icon to view the post in markdown and to edit it. 
Back in the `_posts` folder, click **Create new file** to create a new post.

The head of each post will contain the following:
```
---
layout: post
title:  "6 reasons your values are not aligned with your company"
author: advantages
categories: [ Business ]
image: assets/images/blog002.jpg
tags: [sticky, featured]
---
```
Layout will always be `post`
Title is the title of the post.
The author is your first name in all lowercase.
You can add as many categories as you wish within the brackets, seperated by a comma.
Change the image name to reflect the image you uploaded. Do not change the path though. For example, `assets/images/blog003.jpg`
Tags are optional. `sticky` means that post will go inside of the large rectangle. `featured` means the post will go in the featured list on the bottom right of the page.

Please refer to the [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to learn about writing in markdown.

To add images, enter `assets` folder. Within assets, enter `images` folder. Use the set naming convention of `blog00X` to name images for posts. Try to use `.jpg` images.
